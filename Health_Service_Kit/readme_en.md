## Configuring and Using the Sample App

### Configuring the Sample App in DevEco Studio

1. In [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html), [create a project](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-createproject-0000001100334664) and under the project, [create an app](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-createapp-0000001146718717).
2. [Apply for Huawei Health Service Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/health-apply-0000001770425225-V5)
3. Open the sample app and replace the value of **bundleName** in the **AppScope\app.json5** file with the app package name specified in [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html).
4. Replace the value of **client_id** in the **entry\src\main\module.json5** file with the app's **client_id** configured in [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html).
5. Generate an SHA-256 signing certificate fingerprint and configure it for the app in [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html). For details about how to generate such a fingerprint, go to **Preparations** > **Configuring App Signature Information** in the *Health Service Kit Development Guide*.

#### Using the Sample App
1. Run the sample app. Touch the **Auth** button to access the authorization management screen. Touch **requestAuthorizations** to authorize or log in to the app. If you have not logged in to your device with a HUAWEI ID, the HUAWEI ID log-in screen will display. Log in to your HUAWEI ID, then the app authorization screen will display.
2. Go back to the home screen. Touch **ExerciseSequence** to start managing workout records.

## Implementation Details

Implement authorization-related features by referring to **AuthManagement.ets**.
* Call **AuthorizationRequest** to create an authorization request, pass the data types to read and write, and call **requestAuthorizations** to display the log-in/authorization screen.
* Call **AuthorizationRequest** to create a scope query request, pass the data types to read and write, and call **getAuthorizations** to check whether scopes are granted for reading or writing specific types of data.
* Call **cancelAuthorizations** to cancel the authorization.

Implement features related to workout record management by referring to **ExerciseSequenceManagement**.
* Construct an array with one or multiple data records and call **saveData** to save the data.
* Set data query conditions and call **readData** to read specific data.
* Set data deletion conditions and call **deleteData** to delete specific data.
* Specify an array with one or multiple data records and call **deleteData** to delete the array.
